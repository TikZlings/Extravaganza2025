Structure of the repository:

- "examplescene" is an example scene which you can use as a starting point if you like. The source code for the scenes from previous years is also public.

- "storyboard" is a collection of ideas from our creative mastermind Gert. You can use them, modify them or come up with your own ideas. (and if you have trouble reading some of the scans, just ask)

Our typical workflow:

- pick a scene you'd like to work on. If you'd like to make sure nobody else is already working on that particular scene, you can write a quick mail to all of us with something like "I'd like to do scene xyz next"

- create a folder with your name and, within this a folder, another folder with the name for the scene. There you can place your .tex file and any images etc. you need for the scene. Please don't commit the resulting .pdf file, as it is often very large.

- the bottom centre of the frame is usually a good place for giving credit to the creator of a background image. A list of all the music will be given in the credits at the end of all the videos.

- we have scripts to convert the pdf to video, but you don't have to run them yourself (but you can if you want). Usually people will just commit the .tex code and samcarter will compile it to get the pdf, convert it to movie and show them the resulting video so they can check if the speed of animation is correct etc.

- most of the scenes are around 20 to 40 seconds long. We use 25 frames per second, so ideally the resulting pdf is around 500 to 1000 pages long. However we can also show each page multiple times, so don't worry if you have less pages.

- if you have an idea, but aren't sure how to create it, please feel free to email us. Somebody will usually have an idea how to solve the problem.
